I'm super excited to launch our blog! We'll use this space to share what's happening in our lab, from research papers and systems to the day-to-day life of our team. To kick things off, let's look back at 2025.

## Award-Winning Research

We were super happy to see our work recognized by the community this year!

*   **SIGMOD 2025 Honorable Mention**: Our paper ["DPconv: Super-Polynomially Faster Join Ordering"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08013) by Mihail Stoian and Andreas Kipf received an Honorable Mention at SIGMOD 2025 in Berlin.
*   **EDBT 2025 Best Demo Award**: We were also thrilled to pick up a **Best Demo Award** at EDBT 2025 in Barcelona for ["Virtual: Compressing Data Lake Files"](https://utndatasystems.github.io/virtual/).

## Collaborations

Research in data systems doesn't happen in an ivory tower. We love working closely with industry leaders and top academic labs to solve real-world problems.
*   **SIGMOD 2025 Industrial**: We presented ["Pruning in Snowflake: Working Smarter, Not Harder"](https://snowflakepruning.github.io/) in collaboration with Snowflake, where we explored some cool new pruning techniques.
*   **Google BigQuery & SemBench**: Our work on [**SemBench**](https://sembench.ngrok.io/), a benchmark for semantic query processing engines, is a huge team effort with Google BigQuery, Cornell, TU Berlin, University of Michigan, MIT CSAIL, and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

## A Benchmark-Heavy Year

Benchmarks are the foundation of systems research. While we've been involved in benchmarking for a while (you might know our past work on [**JOB-light**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.00677), [**SOSD**](https://github.com/learnedsystems/SOSD), and [**Redset**](https://github.com/amazon-science/redset)), we've ramped up our efforts in 2025:
*   [**Redbench**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12488): We presented it at aiDM 2025, and we're continuing to develop this workload synthesis work in collaboration with **TU Darmstadt**.
*   [**SemBench**](http://sembench.org/): Our new benchmark, designed specifically for evaluating semantic SQL operators.

## Community Building and Interdisciplinary Research

Beyond the core research, we’ve been connecting with the broader community:
*   **Bavarian Database Day**: We're proud to have organized the very first [**Bavarian Database Day**](https://databaseday.de/), which brought together researchers and practitioners from Bavaria and beyond.
*   **Podcast Feature**: Mihail Stoian hopped on the **Disseminate podcast** to talk about our work on robust query execution in the [**episode on Parachute**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfZuVtY5lZg).
*   **UTN Internal Milestone**: We even published a first [**cross-department workshop paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10391), which was a big step for interdisciplinary research here at UTN.

## Everything Else!

It wouldn't be a proper recap without mentioning all the other cool stuff we did:
*   **BTW 2025**: I was co-organizing the [**ML4Sys and Sys4ML workshop**](https://luthramanisha.github.io/ML4Sys-and-Sys4ML/) at BTW 2025, and I also gave a talk about ["Workload-Driven Indexing in the Cloud"](https://itu-dasyalab.github.io/btw2025workshop/).
*   **Dagstuhl Seminar**: I attended a very cool Dagstuhl seminar on [**Table Representation Learning**](https://www.dagstuhl.de/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/25182), which is actually where we first kicked off our work on SemBench.
*   **Lab Offsite**: We had a nice summer offsite south of Nuremberg. Between working on **ML-based data compression**, we managed to squeeze in some fun swimming and wakeboarding at the nearby lake.
*   **VLDB Presentations**: We were also busy in London at VLDB. We presented ["Instance-Optimized String Fingerprints"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10391) at AIDB and [**Parachute**](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13670) at the main Research Track.
*   **Long Night of Sciences**: We presented our agentic data analytics platform [**DataLoom**](https://utndatasystems.github.io/data-loom/) and our data lake file format [**Virtual**](https://utndatasystems.github.io/virtual/) at the [**Long Night of Sciences**](https://nacht-der-wissenschaften.de/).

All in all, it's been a crazy year, and I couldn't be more proud of what we've achieved. I'm super excited for what 2026 has in store. Stay tuned!
